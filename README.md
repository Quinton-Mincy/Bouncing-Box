# Welcome to My Bouncing-Box

## Task

Recreating Famous Bouncing Windows Screensaver

## Description

The program dynamically determines the size of the screen and, when an edge of the animated box reaches the and edge of the current screen, it moves in the opposite direction, creating a bouncing effect. 

## Moving Forward

A few features that could be added to the project would be to change the color of the box whenever it bounces off an edge, perhaps creating some special effect when the box lands perfectly in the corner of the screen. Another feature would be to implement custom shapes, perhaps adding a UI for a user to change the shape, color, and text displayed in the moving entity.
